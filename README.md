# hcde-410-final
This research project is intended to bring out the effects of individual and community factors like age group, race, disability status and risk factors like Covid-19 pandemic in the anxiety and depression conditions of people in the United States. This project approaches the objectives in an analytical way and uses results of data analysis to establish facts related to factors affecting symptoms of anxiety and depression. 

I’m doing this analysis because talking about anxiety and depression and its side effects is close to my heart as I’ve suffered from it during the covid years, with some unexpected side effects. I’m not an expert by any means, I just know how incredibly hard having your brain not work as you want it to, can be.


### Data Selected for Analysis

**(1) The first data selected for analysis is:**
https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp. 

- The data is freely available to use from the CDC website and has information needed to make this study relevant, that is the anxiety and depression trends in the United States with groups such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, national estimate; and subgroup such as male/female, age number, hispanic or latino. The data time range for this data started from May 20th 2020 to now last updated April 20th 2022 (as I am analyzing this data).

**(2) The second data selected for analysis:** https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycase.
- The data is also freely available to use from the CDC website and It has covid 19 cases data trend to answer research question 3.


### Research Questions / Hypothesis
Questions that arise from my problem statements are:

1. How is levels of anxiety and that of depression related ?
2. How is anxiety and depression level related with age group ? (percentage of symptoms with the interval of 10 years).
3. How has depression and anxiety levels changed with time? What is the role of covid 19 pandemic in this trend?
4. What is the impact of race in the rate of change of depression and anxiety levels ?
5. What is the impact of disability status in the rate of change of depression and anxiety levels ?


### Background and/or Related Work

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic aggravated an already existing public mental health problem. Mental disorders were already the [global leading causes of the health-related burden](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02143-7/fulltext), especially depressive and anxiety disorders. As a consequence of COVID-19, the pandemic created an environment exacerbating the determinants of poor mental health. Emotional distress, stress, irritability, anger, and mood swings are [among the symptoms of mental trauma](https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-020-00589-w) related to the pandemic. According to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America (ADAA), [40 million American adults aged 18 and older](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/facts-statistics#:~:text=GAD%2520affects%25206.8%2520million%2520adults,to%2520be%2520affected%2520as%2520men.) suffer anxiety disorders; the most common mental illness in the United States (US). Fear and grief associated with disease spread, social restrictions, and other pandemic containment measures to reduce mortality and morbidity worsen psychological wellbeing because of feelings of isolation and even loss of livelihoods and loved ones. Unsurprisingly, the percentage of individuals with anxiety or a depressive disorder symptom increased from [36.4% to 41.5%](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e2.htm#suggestedcitation) during the August 2020-to-February 2021 period. With the reality of worsening situations related to mental health, understanding the trends of anxiety and depression is crucial in guiding health and public policy formulation. As the burden of psychological disorders continues to plague the healthcare system, there is a need for better risk assessment as well as intervention and prevention.
